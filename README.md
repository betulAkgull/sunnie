Sunnie is a simple weather forecast app, that uses some APIs to fetch 5-day forecast data from the <a href = "https://www.visualcrossing.com/">Visual Crossing API</a> and <a href = "https://locationiq.com/">LocationIQ</a> to fetch places. To store your Visual Crossing and LocationIQ API key, add it to your local.properties file as follows:

```kotlin
  SEARCH_API_KEY=[YOUR_API_KEY]  //LocationIQ Key
  API_KEY=[YOUR_API_KEY]       //Visual Crossing Key
```
